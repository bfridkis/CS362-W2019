					Starting randomtestadventurer - Testing 'adventurer' card

  Executing 1 Adventurer play using hands with random assortment of 
	  supply cards, with at least 2 treasures in deck...

		 -Set 'ADVENTURER_CALLS' in randomtestadventurer.c
		  to modify number of plays.

  BOUNDARY: Executing Adventurer play using hand with random assortment of 
	            supply cards, with 1 treasure card in deck...

  BOUNDARY: Executing Adventurer play using hand with random assortment of 
	            supply cards, with 0 treasure cards in deck...

  BOUNDARY: Executing Adventurer play using hand with random assortment of 
	            supply cards, with 0 cards in deck (should be same outcome as no
				  treasure cards...)


	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RESULTS SUMMARY ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Each test (that is not marked 'BOUNDARY') verifies proper game state
	modification, reporting a failure if any of the following conditions are NOT met:
		1. Current player variable (whoseTurn) is unchanged
		2. Player's hand gains only 2 treasure cards from deck
			a. Same 2 treasure card types are removed from deck and added to hand.
			b. Deck count and hand counts are updated correctly
		3. Hand does not gain any non-treasure cards
		4. Discard does not gain any treasure cards
		5. All non-treasure cards removed from deck are added to hand
		6. All of the following game states are unchanged:
			a. coins
			b. numActions
			c. numBuys
			d. embargoTokens[]
			e. outpostPlayed
			f. outpostTurn
		7. Played card count is unchanged
		8. Played cards is unchanged

		*  BOUNDARY tests verify all of the above except for #2a, where instead  *
		*  the boundary case checks for the appropriate number of treasure card  *
		*  removals and insertions based on the designated treasure card amount  *
		*  (i.e. as is passed in via the 'treasureCardCountSpecifier' variable.) *
		
		********************* NOTE FOR BOUNDARY CASE / BUG REPORT ****************** 
		**																		   ** 
		** Technically, the Adventurer card does not explicitly state what should ** 
		**    be done in the event that the set of the player's deck and discard  ** 
		**     piles do not contain a total of at least 2 treasure cards. For a   ** 
		**       'literal minded' machine such as a computer, this creates an     ** 
		** infinite loop of sorts, that must be handled accordingly. The findings ** 
		**  of this testing exercise have indicated a bug related to this aspect  ** 
		**  of adventurer, one which does not result in a stuck loop but rather   ** 
		** incorrect behavior in some conditions (i.e. when discard and deck do   ** 
		**  not contain at least 2 treasures, but hand has enough to make up the  ** 
		** difference) or a segmentation fault in others (i.e. when there are not ** 
		**   at least 2 treasures between deck, discard, and hand combined). This ** 
		**   program (randomtestadventurer) has been deliberately set up to avoid a full on  ** 
		**    crash due to this error, so that all remaining tests and code will  ** 
		**     be processed to completion. The incorrect behavior (that does not  ** 
		** result in a full crash) caused by this bug is captured in the BOUNDARY ** 
		**  test results. Please see cardEffects.c and the assignment write-up    ** 
		**                  for a complete description of the error.              ** 
		**                                                                        ** 
		**  (The bug mentioned above was NOT introduced as part of assignment 2.  ** 
		**    The test results here should indicate additional findings which     ** 
		**          ARE the result of bugs introduced for assignment 2.)          ** 
		**                                                                        **
