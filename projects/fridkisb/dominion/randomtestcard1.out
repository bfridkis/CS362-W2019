		  Result for running randomtestcard1 (random tests for Council Room):
									randomtestcard1:
				Starting randomtestcard1 - Testing 'council_room' card

  Executing 10000 Council_Room plays using hands and decks with random assortment
	  of supply cards, with at least 1 card in deck for non-active players,
	  and 4 cards in deck for active players. Hand and deck sizes are random
	  for each player, up to sizes MAX_HAND and MAX_DECK respectively. The number
	  of players is random up to MAX_PLAYER. The active player is chosen randomly,
	  as well as the starting hand position for the active player's council_room card.
	  The entire game state is randomized before play, and only pertinent data
	  structures are initialized to known values thereafter. The seed value for the
	  game is random based on the system clock to ensure non-determinism.

		 -Set 'COUNCIL_ROOM_CALLS' in randomtestcard1.c
		  to modify number of plays.

  BOUNDARY: Executing Council_Room play using hand with random assortment of
	            supply cards, with empty decks for all players...


	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ RESULTS SUMMARY ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	Each test (that is not marked 'BOUNDARY') verifies proper game state
	modification, reporting a failure if any of the following conditions are met:
		1. Current player variable (whoseTurn) is changed
		2. Active player's hand does not gain 4 cards from the top of active player's deck
			a. Active player's deck count is not decremented by 4.
			b. Active player's hand count is not incremented by 3
					(A total of 4 cards are gained from the deck but the Council_Room
					itself is discarded so the net gain from the hand should be 3.)
			c. Active player's deck contents are not the same before and after the play
					(Besides the 4 less cards gained therefrom.
						i.e. The deck order is not changed.)
			d. Active player's hand content is changed
					(Besides the 4 additional cards gained to the end of the hand from
						the top of the deck)
		3. Inactive players' hands do not gain 1 card from the top of each respective
			player's own deck
			a. Inactive players' deck counts are not decremented by 1.
			b. Inactive players' hand counts are not incremented by 1
			c. Inactive players' deck contents are not the same before and after the play
					(Besides the 1 less cards gained therefrom.
						i.e. The deck order is not changed.)
			d. Inactive players' hand contents are changed
					(Besides the additional card gained to the end of the hand from the top
						of the deck
		4. Active player's discard pile does not gain a council_room, or count is not 1
				(starts at 0)
		5. Inactive players' discard piles are changed, or counts are not 0
				(all start at 0)
		6. numBuys game state is not incremented by 1 (starts at 0)
		7. Any supply pile count (curses, victory cards, or kingdom cards) is changed
		8. Any of the following game states are changed:
			a. coins
			b. numActions
			c. embargoTokens[]
			d. outpostPlayed
			e. outpostTurn
		9. Played card count is not 1
		10. Played cards does not have Council_Room @ idx 1 and is unchanged otherwise

		* BOUNDARY test verifies all of the above except for #2 & #3. For the empty    *
		* deck boundary test, no deck or hand count or contents should change for any  *
		* player, with the one exception of the active player's hand, which should be  *
		* decremented by exactly 1 council_room.                                       *
