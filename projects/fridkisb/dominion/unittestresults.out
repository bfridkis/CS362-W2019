					 31% - <41%  : 0
					 41% - <51%  : 0
					   >51%      : 250

	The above values represent the number of tests for which the MINIMUM
	number of observed changes divided by the deck size used produced the
	given percentage. For example, if a deck size of 20 was compared before
	and after shuffle, and 10 deck indexes contained the same card type both
	before and after shuffle, while the other 10 deck indexes contained different
	card types (when comparing the before and after decks), the test generated a
	variance value of 50%. The above values are the incidence of tests in each
	percentage range.

	Note that a few tests in the lower ranges may not indicate a faulty shuffle
	function, as these may be the result of very small deck sizes. However,
	a large incidence in the lower ranges may indicate that shuffle is not
	adequately redistributing the cards within the deck, while a large incidence
	at the '0' range specifically may indicate that shuffle is not redistributing
	the cards at all.

	Finally, it is important to note that this variance test DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR
	CARD EXCHANGES OF THE SAME CARD TYPE. In other words, more shuffling may be
	(and likely is) occurring than is accounted for by these numbers (and hence
	the emphasis on 'minimum' above). This is an important consideration to take
	into account when evaluating these statistics, especially when the low variance
	ranges have low incidence. (In other words, a relatively low incidence for the
	low variance ranges may not necessarily indicate an issue with shuffle.)

	(Max number of tests in this breakdown is NUM_SHUFFLES + 1, as the MAX_DECK
	 deck size shuffle test is included but the empty deck shuffle test is not.)

		********************* NOTE FOR BOUNDARY CASE / BUG REPORT ****************** 
		**																		   ** 
		** Technically, the Adventurer card does not explicitly state what should ** 
		**    be done in the event that the set of the player's deck and discard  ** 
		**     piles do not contain a total of at least 2 treasure cards. For a   ** 
		**       'literal minded' machine such as a computer, this creates an     ** 
		** infinite loop of sorts, that must be handled accordingly. The findings ** 
		**  of this testing exercise have indicated a bug related to this aspect  ** 
		**  of adventurer, one which does not result in a stuck loop but rather   ** 
		** incorrect behavior in some conditions (i.e. when discard and deck do   ** 
		**  not contain at least 2 treasures, but hand has enough to make up the  ** 
		** difference) or a segmentation fault in others (i.e. when there are not ** 
		**   at least 2 treasures between deck, discard, and hand combined). This ** 
		**   program (cardtest2) has been deliberately set up to avoid a full on  ** 
		**    crash due to this error, so that all remaining tests and code will  ** 
		**     be processed to completion. The incorrect behavior (that does not  ** 
		** result in a full crash) caused by this bug is captured in the BOUNDARY ** 
		**  test results. Please see cardEffects.c and the assignment write-up    ** 
		**                  for a complete description of the error.              ** 
		**                                                                        ** 
		**  (The bug mentioned above was NOT introduced as part of assignment 2.  ** 
		**    The test results here should indicate additional findings which     ** 
		**          ARE the result of bugs introduced for assignment 2.)          ** 
		**                                                                        **
